This is an unfinished colege project for a graphic adventure where you have to solve a crime by using objects and talking to people.
Most of the art and code are done, and the story is completely written. 
The gameplay loop is closed, so the game in this stage is playable. There were plans to make puzzles for players to solve, but the only
one we had time for was a timing puzzle that ended up not being implemented.
